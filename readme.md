# SkML

SkML is a Python library for predicting magnetic parameters from MFM images. 


## Installation

The ML model is not provided, to there is nothing to install. For users who wish to create their own models, a good Python library to use is [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Tensorflow can be installed with the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Install other libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib) as required in a similar manner, preferably in a virtual environment.
